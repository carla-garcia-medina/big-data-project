### Analytics steps

#### Cleaning and Profiling for dataset1 (health expenditure)
* Pyspark

#### Cleaning and Profiling for dataset2 (coverage) ####
* The first part of the cleaning was done using MapReduce
* Pyspark was used for the second part of cleaning and for profiling

#### Merging and First correlation ####
